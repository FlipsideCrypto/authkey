As the largest organization of Web3 analysts, members of [MetricsDAO](https://metricsdao.xyz) come together to create some of the highest quality blockchain analytical work routinely. Working together to produce on-demand analytics for partner institutions, chains, and protocols; MetricsDAO has reached a scale of driving knowledge with the power of data. 

To grow their participant network and further empower existing analysts, MetricsDAO runs education programs through their Academy.

When MetricsDAO started managing their education initiative with [Badger](/). Organizing education is very difficult. But, with Badger the team at MetricsDAO has the ability to group members into classes, cohorts, education plans and more. Quickly they realized they had found the right tool to grow a multi-faceted network of passionate students and instructors.

Currently, [MetricsDAO Academy](https://blog.metricsdao.xyz/101/) runs live and asynchronous courses on Web3 analytics and has taught hundreds of individuals how to parse and analyze crypto data.

> Badger has allowed MetricsDAO's education team to set its own direction in giving recognition to network participants. Minting Badger badges doesn't depend on third-party approvals or other external processes. Recognizing roles and achievements is now at our fingertips!

## Meaningful representation of achievement

As [MetricsDAO](https://metricsdao.xyz) began their educational initiative with the Academy, they adopted [Badger](/) to make cohort management easier. While achieving their goal of reaching the right people, Badges added excitement to the process as students were [eager to show off their achievements](/stories/taptive/#immortalizing-accomplishments-onchain).

With the ability to mint Badges onchain, MetricsDAO was able to create a new way to recognize achievement and to provide a meaningful representation of their educational programs. Plus, Badger's permissionless interface made it easy for students to share their Badges on social media and to use them in other places of the web.

Badges now serve multiple purposes in MetricsDAO Academy including creating [access points for instructors](/stories/pinedao/#plugging-into-the-atmosphere-of-web3), recognizing achievement, and enabling coordination of future cohorts. 

## Reaching the right people

Badges represent student achievements onchain and are used alongside [Guild.xyz](https://guild.xyz) to gate access to various [Discord](https://discord.gg) channels. 

Instructors and facilitators use these purpose driven spaces to get the right content to the right people at the right time. While Discord permissions may become overwhelming in large organizations, combining the use of Guild and Badger's simple interface has made it straightforward to [empower coordinators to add new students to the right channels](/stories/talentdao/#Driving-sub-DAO-autonomy).

## Students become teachers

As students have graduated from various courses, the team has used Badger to maintain communication with top students and to build out their teaching assistant network. 

The public nature of Badger networks and permissionless interface makes it easy for new instructors to move from Badge holder to operator. By using [Badger](/) to identify their cohorts, [MetricsDAO Academy](https://blog.metricsdao.xyz/101/) laid the foundation for network evolution and empowered their cohort participants to manage their own cohorts.

As students have reacted positively to the Badges, [MetricsDAO is now increasing its focus on education and has already minted over 3,000 Badges](https://opensea.io/collection/metricsdao-academy). 

As their students learn new skills and receive Badges, MetricsDAO is able to reach the right people through onchain identifiers and empower them to become contributors in future education initiatives or to provide other work opportunities to them.
