[2] - Contract integration

[10]- Finish the static implementation of the Dashboard pages. @mason
    - Determine placement of API post and get requests
    - Determine when we're running the transactions
    - Post request after a transaction is completed to show that the obj in database is not a ghost obj.
[3] - Wallet integration.
    - Pending completion of contract integration.
[3] - Setup redirecting of the actual deployment.
    - This will take just a few seconds. It would be nice to go ahead and get namespace. Should just do this next time someone hits a wall.
    - Reminder that FontAwesome is going to be bad when deploying due to it's key management process.
