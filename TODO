CONTRACT: 
    ☐ Full test suite
        Make sure to test the metadata shit!!
    ☐ Is there any case where someone could rightfully need multiple copies of the same badge?
        If so, add a require statement to mint and remove the balanceOf in burn.
            Wtf did I mean by a require statement to mint
    ☐ Is there a reason to have the createBadge/updateBadge as separate functions?
        They do literally the same thing just with a revert if there's an existing badge on the createBadge()

Contract Interaction:
    ✔ Deploy a contract via front end @done(22-07-10 21:33)
        To deploy the clone and get the clone contract within ethers:
        cloneTx = await proxy.connect(owner).deployOrg();
        cloneTx = await cloneTx.wait();        
        testOrgAddress = cloneTx.events[0].args[1]
        testOrg = await org.attach(testOrgAddress);
    ☐ Way to show transaction errors
    ☐ Better explanation of the clone and initialize double transaction.
    ☐ 
    ☐ Do test walk throughs and polish UX
    ☐ Add gnosis as a chain
    ☐ Set up host
    ☐ Implement new brand
    
V1.01:
