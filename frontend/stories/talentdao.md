description: Traditional businesses and organizations have historically used methods of top-down management to streamline operations by attempting to lower costs and more strongly control internal actions and external outputs. TalentDAO believes in a decentralized workforce and performs studies to achieve that vision.

Decentralization has become a buzzword in recent years, and for good reason. 

Traditional top-down management structures have shown to have limitations in terms of collaboration, creativity, and accountability. That's why [TalentDAO](https://www.talentdao.io/), a community of organizational scientists, strategists, and researchers, is pioneering a decentralized approach to work, and they are using [Badger](/) to achieve it.

TalentDAO's vision is to create a world where people can work freely, on their own terms, without relying on third-party institutions. They believe that traditional approaches to work have led to human coordination failures, and that knowledge should be open-source. 

To achieve their vision, TalentDAO has created a community of like-minded individuals who conduct scientific research to [help DAOs thrive and educate the public on the benefits of a decentralized future of work](/stories/taptive/#Mobilizing-recognition-across-communities).

## DAO Leadership behaviors that drive outcomes

One of the challenges TalentDAO faced was how to manage their needs effectively. While many onchain communities are bottom-up, they found that traditional employment networks were too top-down for their needs. That's where Badger came in.

Badger is a web3 credential tool that enables organizations to decentralize using open data and a permissionless protocol. By using Badger, TalentDAO was able to provide distinct onchain representations of their sub-DAOs and responsibilities. 

This allowed each group to manage their collaboration spaces on Discord, voting spaces on Snapshot, and access other tools, all with their own governance processes in place.

For example, TalentDAO's Research Guild and Marketing Guild have both been represented onchain with Badger. 

Each guild has its own governance process in [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/), which allows members to propose and vote on decisions. This gives each guild a level of autonomy, while still being part of the larger TalentDAO community.

## Open data and permissionless primitives

By using Badger, TalentDAO has been able to create a middle-out management approach that empowers its members. Badger enables teams to design middle-out networks because anyone can create a network, and networks are public. This means that TalentDAO can create a more decentralized approach to work, where each member has a say in how the community is run.

## Leading Change with Cohorts

Cohorts are a great way to onboard new members into a community, and Badger makes it easy to do so.

TalentDAO has also been using Badger to create cohorts of people who are interested in learning about decentralized work. These cohorts are a way for TalentDAO to educate people on the benefits of decentralized work, and to help them get started with their own DAOs.
