> I have already had students ask me if the badges can be shown on LinkedIn; people are taking our Badges as real signs of achievement.

As MetricsDAO began their educational initiative with the Academy, they adopted Badger to make cohort management easier. Badges serve multiple purposes in MetricsDAO Academy including recognizing acheivement, creating access, and enabling future coordination. Badges represent student achievements on-chain and are used alongside Guild to gate access to various Discord channels. As students have graduated from various courses, the team has used Badger to maintain communication with top students and to build out their teaching assistant network which is also managed with Badger.


As students have reacted positively to the Badges, MetricsDAO has increased its focus on education running multiple cohorts and minting over 3000 Badges.
