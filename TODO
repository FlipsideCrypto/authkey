This todo is using Kanban format. Every number next to it is the priority. Just choose what you want and knock it out:

[] Todo
[1] - (v3) Wallet based JWT tokens
[2] - API Endpoint that returns which "tutorial state" should be shown on a users profile page.
[1] - Enable SSL on Netlify
[2] - Contract integration

[] Stating
[6] - Standing API to process base requests of v2. @chance

[] In Progress
[10] - Finish the static implementation of the Dashboard pages. @mason
     - Determine placement of API post and get requests
     - Determine when we're running the transactions
     - Post request after a transaction is completed to show that the obj in database is not a ghost obj.
[9]  - Navigation in general
        - The Header navigation should be directly linked and not just back in the history
        - I feel like there's probably an issue somewhere with how query params are being handled
[9]  - Badges shown in navbar when in an org level dash page
[6]  - need to throw an error if api call resolves but returns null without error raise

[] Review
[3] - Wallet integration.
    - Pending completion of contract integration.
[5] - Possibly use local cache for org and user data instead of context

[] Done
[3] - Setup redirecting of the actual deployment.
    - This will take just a few seconds. It would be nice to go ahead and get namespace. Should just do this next time someone hits a wall.
    - Reminder that FontAwesome is going to be bad when deploying due to it's key management process.

=========================================
                OLD TODO
=========================================

This needs to be cleaned out with the new v2 functionality in mind

SUMMARY:
    ☐ Entering app needs some page to determine if they currently have a set or if they're new
    ☐ API GET for a wallet's sets and badges
    ☐ Fix sizing and styling of landing page images.
    ☐ Need link to a usable Flipside query.
    ☐ Make sure the post minting API post works properly.
    ☐ Mobile resizing
        ☐ Navbar needs mobile hamburger

CRITICAL:
    ☐ Mint Page
        ☐ Check for if minting amount > 100? 80? 
    ☐ Manage Set Page
        ☐ Small switch that changes from mint to revoke
        ☐ API get for all badges of contract address
        ☐ API get ownership records
    ☐ Overhaul API endpoints
        ☐ Getter endpoint for both
        ☐ Updater? (maybe v1.01)
        ☐ Getter for ownership records of a contract address
    ☐ Stepper needs green font when completed
    ☐ Mobile redesign
    ☐ ENSURE THAT ONLY THE FRONT END CAN MAKE POST REQUESTS TO THE BACKEND.
    ☐ Preview bar needs better sizing and distribution of children
    ☐ Check out runner tests
        Need to implement these and dev around them to be sure the security of org data is correct.
        As of now everything is open and there's probably a plethora of security bugs.

CONTRACT: 
    ☐ Contract deployed on Polygon and tested
    ☐ Find way to parse RPC errors
    
ACTIVE:
    ☐ Home Dashboard
        Displays all sets, can click into a set to see all badges and revoke or mint from here.
    ☐ Manage Badges
        ☐ Rename, new image for badges
    ☐ Do test walk throughs and polish UX
    
V1.01:
    ☐ Signature to get into dashboard
    ☐ Rate limit IPFS upload
    ☐ Add webm conversion for preview and IPFS upload
    ☐ Blocknative events for tx not done through our front end
    ☐ FAQ Page
    ☐ Add gnosis as a chain
    ☐ SVGs not rendering from ipfs
