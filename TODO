    ☐ API GET for a wallet's sets and badges
    ☐ Fix sizing and styling of landing page images.
    ☐ Need link to a usable Flipside query.
    ☐ Make sure the post minting API post works properly.

CRITICAL:
    ☐ Mint Page
        ☐ Check for if minting amount > 100? 80? 
    ☐ Manage Set Page
        ☐ Small switch that changes from mint to revoke
        ☐ API get for all badges of contract address
        ☐ API get ownership records
    ☐ Overhaul API endpoints
        ☐ Getter endpoint for both
        ☐ Updater? (maybe v1.01)
        ☐ Getter for ownership records of a contract address
    ☐ Stepper needs green font when completed
    ☐ SVGs not rendering from ipfs

CONTRACT: 
    ☐ Contract deployed on Polygon and tested
    ☐ Find way to parse RPC errors

    ☐ Manage Badges
        ☐ Rename, new image for badges
    ☐ ENSURE THAT ONLY THE FRONT END CAN MAKE POST REQUESTS TO THE BACKEND.

        CORS perms is probably fucked
    ☐ Do test walk throughs and polish UX
    
V1.01:
