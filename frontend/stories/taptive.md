quote: Digital certificates and awards given off chain are easily lost and rarely resurfaced. When we issue awards on chain, participants are able to bring their reputation and accomplishments with them wherever they go.

## Immortalizing accomplishments on-chain

> Issuing NFTs through Badger has improved the experienceof participants because they leave with recognition from Taptive of their accomplishments. Having on-chain Badges has also increased engagement because cohort participants know there is an award at the end of the cohort.

Taptive was inspired to start using Badger because they were looking for an easy way to issue on-chain rewards to participants who completed their cohorts. With Badger, Taptive is able to easily issue NFTs for their cohort participants.

Before Badger, Taptive would simply convey rewards socially such as announcing winners in their Discord. However, with Badger, they are now able to recognize competition winners with an on-chain NFT that they can hold onto and share with others.

## The easiest way to issue badges

After reviewing a number of options ranging from sophisticated reputation management protocols and NFT minting apps, Taptive chose Badger as their tool of choice. While other options may appear to have extra features or appear simpler, Grant found that Badger's simple interface was the best tool for the job and gave recipients the extensibility necessary.

Taptive is able to distribute account bound credentials with the click of the button. 

## Mobilizing recognition across communities

Taptive plans to continue to utilize Badger in the future by recognizing winners of cohort competitions, creating a large network of writers who are recognized with Taptive credentials on-chain. By integrating Badger into their communities, participants of Taptive's cohorts can take their engagement from Taptive and demonstrate their skills locally within their home community.
