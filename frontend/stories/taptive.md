## Immortalizing accomplishments onchain

> Issuing NFTs through Badger has improved the experienceof participants because they leave with recognition from Taptive of their accomplishments. Having onchain Badges has also increased engagement because cohort participants know there is an award at the end of the cohort.

[Taptive](https://taptive.xyz) was inspired to start using [Badger](/) because they were looking for an easy way to issue onchain rewards to participants who completed their cohorts. With Badger, Taptive is able to easily issue NFTs for their cohort participants.

Before Badger, Taptive would simply convey rewards socially such as announcing winners in their Discord. But, if someone wasn't around to experience the glamor and communicty excitement it was easy to miss the culture building opportunity. 

Now, with Badger they are now able to recognize competition winners with an onchain Badge that they can hold onto and [share with others](/stories/mdao/#meaningful-representation-of-achievement).
 
## The easiest way to issue badges

After reviewing a number of options ranging from sophisticated reputation management protocols and NFT minting apps, Taptive chose Badger as their tool of choice. While other options may appear to have extra features or appear simpler, Grant found that Badger's simple interface was the best tool for the job and gave recipients the extensibility necessary.

Taptive plans to continue to utilize [Badger](/) in the future by recognizing winners of cohort competitions, creating a large network of writers who are recognized with Taptive credentials onchain. By integrating Badger into their communities, participants of Taptive's cohorts can take their engagement from Taptive and demonstrate their skills locally within their home community.
