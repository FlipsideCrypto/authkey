description: Traditional businesses and organizations have historically used methods of top-down management to streamline operations by attempting to lower costs and more strongly control internal actions and external outputs. Inside every organization, whether real or digital, there exists an internal definition of who has access to do what.

## Limiting tools, limited output

> We had a very basic WordPress blog that was built years before that was a pain to update, and that none of our engineers wanted to get involved with. Beyond that, we had none of our reporting tools set up on the blog, so we had no visibility on the impact our content efforts were making.

As Freshly began exploring expanded content marketing efforts in 2019, they faced a problem: getting new content live — whether that be on their blog or as web pages  — was a slow, engineering-driven process. The blog was a neglected, outdated WordPress instance that “was a pain to update, and that none of our engineers wanted to get involved with,” according to Product Manager Christopher Patota. As for the website, new pages needed to be coded by hand by engineers, which meant competing for prioritization with core product related projects.

To remove these obstacles, Freshly’s cross-functional content team was organized to find a better way for the team to build, launch, and measure the impact of new content efforts.
