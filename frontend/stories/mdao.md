When MetricsDAO started managing their education initiative with Badger, they realized they had found the right tool to grow a multi-faceted network of passionate students and instructors. MetricsDAO Academy runs live and asynchronous courses on Web3 analytics and has taught hundreds of individuals how to parse and analyze crypto data.

# Meaningful representation of achievement

As MetricsDAO began their educational initiative with the Academy, they adopted Badger to make cohort management easier. While achieving their goal of reaching the right people, Badger Badges added excitement to the process as students were eager to show off their achievements.

Badges now serve multiple purposes in MetricsDAO Academy including creating access points for instructors, recognizing achievement, and enabling coordination of future cohorts. 

## Reaching the right people

 Badges represent student achievements on-chain and are used alongside Guild to gate access to various Discord channels. Instructors and facilitators use these purpose driven spaces to get the right content to the right people at the right time. While Discord permissions may become overwhelming in large organizations, Badger's simple interface makes it easy to empower coordinators to add new students to the right channels.

## Students become teachers

 As students have graduated from various courses, the team has used Badger to maintain communication with top students and to build out their teaching assistant network. The public nature of Badger networks and permissionless interface makes it easy for new instructors to move from Badge holder to operator. By using Badger to identify their cohorts, MetricsDAO Academy laid the foundation for network evolution and empowered their cohort participants to manage their own cohorts.

As students have reacted positively to the Badges, MetricsDAO has increased its focus on education running multiple cohorts and minting over 3000 Badges.
