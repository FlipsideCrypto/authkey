quote: Digital certificates and awards given off chain are easily lost and rarely resurfaced. When we issue awards on chain, participants are able to bring their reputation and accomplishments with them wherever they go.

## Immortalizing recognition on-chain

> We do everything we can to improve the cohort experience. Issuing NFTs through Badger has improved the participants experience because they leave with recognition from Taptive of their accomplishments. Having on chain awards has also increased engagement because cohort participants know there is an award at the end of the cohort.

Taptive was inspired to start using Badger because they were looking for an easy way to issue on-chain rewards to participants who completed their cohorts. They found Badger to be the supremely easy option compared to other solutions on the market. With Badger, Taptive is able to easily issue NFTs for their cohort participants. Before Badger, Taptive would simply issue social rewards such as announcing winners in their Discord. However, with Badger, they are now able to recognize competition winners with an on-chain NFT that they can hold onto and share with others.

Taptive plans to continue to utilize Badger in the future by recognizing winners of cohort competitions. As Taptive continues to grow its reach and impact, Badger can be the solution to all of its credentialing needs, creating a large network of writers who are recognized with Taptive credentials on-chain.
