NFT Credential Issuer for organizations implementing on chain roles, titles, payment plans, and other tracking functions for their members and employees.

Badger is intended to be used as a way for organizations to bootstrap on-chain roles and token-gated areas for their members.

Simply walk through the 3 step process of setting up a collection for your Set of Badges, create your different Badge types, and then mint at will on Polygon.

With the initial Polygon roll out, all metadata is on chain and images are automatically hosted and pinned on IPFS. Never worry about losing provenance of your Badges.

*** IN PROGRESS ***
